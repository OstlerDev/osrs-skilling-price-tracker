# OSRS Bolt Monitor

Maximize your Old School RuneScape profits with real-time bolt enchanting market analysis. This lightweight menu bar application helps you identify profitable enchanting opportunities without constantly checking prices or doing mental math.

## Why Use This?

Bolt enchanting can be one of OSRS's most profitable skilling methods, often yielding 500k-2m GP per hour. However, its profitability fluctuates wildly based on market conditions, and calculating real profits means tracking multiple items:

- Base bolt prices (Ruby & Diamond Dragon Bolts)
- Enchanted bolt prices
- Rune costs (Cosmic, Blood, and Law runes)
- Grand Exchange purchase limits
- Market volatility

This tool does all the heavy lifting for you:
- Monitors prices in real-time
- Calculates exact profit margins
- Tracks your GE purchase limits
- Notifies you of profitable opportunities
- Shows everything at a glance in your menu bar

Perfect for players who want to:
- Make consistent profits from skilling
- Optimize their enchanting sessions
- Track market opportunities passively
- Avoid loss-making market conditions
